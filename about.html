                    <p class="letter-greeting">Greetings, Delegates and Future Leaders!</p>

                    <div class="letter-content">
                        <p>The Secretary Generals of <strong>YLSMUN 2026</strong> extends its most enthusiastic welcome to you. Our mission is clear: to move beyond the conventional MUN experience. Our goal here is not merely to provide an intellectually enriching and awesome weekend but to fundamentally redefine the Model UN circuit and offer you a tangible glimpse of your future as a responsible, impactful leader.</p>

                        <h3 class="letter-section-title">The Leader's Toolkit</h3>
                        <p>We recognize that a leader's skills are their most formidable weapon. Whether you are navigating the complex dynamics of a UN committee, steering a multinational company, or charting the course of a country, your skills will serve as your unwavering compass. Every successful leader, while unique, must build their foundation upon the pillars of humility, unwavering confidence, sharp diplomacy, and measured authority. To meticulously hone these essential skills and put them to the ultimate test, the Secretariat of YLS proudly brings to you the transformative platform of "YLSMUN'2026".</p>

                        <h3 class="letter-section-title">The YLSMUN Revolution: Raising the Standard</h3>
                        <p>For too long, the Model UN circuit has been marred by complaints of systemic bias, toxic environments, and a general decline in the quality of debate and effort. To these lacklustre conferences, we declare: <strong>The revolution is not coming—it is already here!</strong></p>

                        <p>YLSMUN'2026 is poised to set a new national benchmark. We are proud to be North India's first independent, fully youth-led and run MUN. This conference is an unprecedented project, coordinated by a dedicated team of Organising Committee members and Heads of Department who are current student leaders committed to laying the foundation for a brighter, fairer future in student governance. This ensures an unbiased, dynamic, and passionately executed conference.</p>

                        <p>You can expect an experience of unparalleled quality:</p>
                        <ul class="letter-list">
                            <li><strong>Customized Delegate Kits:</strong> Designed not just as souvenirs, but as tools to enhance your experience.</li>

                            <li><strong>Fresh Ideas and Impeccable Execution:</strong> From innovative committee agendas to world-class logistical support, every detail has been meticulously planned to take you on a journey of awe, amazement, and profound self-discovery.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="letter-section-title">Our Pledge to You</h3>
